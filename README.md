# Blockly Front-End

The prototype front-end can be accessed via https://cjphs.github.io/DACS_3-1_9. Note that this requires a HTTPS proxy server to the back-end server in order to execute code.  
If no HTTPS proxy is available, you can run the front-end locally by opening `index.html`.  
To execute code, enter the IP address of the back-end server and the token string as defined in `token.txt`.
