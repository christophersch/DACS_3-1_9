*Authors: Christophe Raso, Christopher Schiffmann, Gevorg Chakrian, Ingo Heijnens, Janis Eicher, Pepijn van der Meer*

Third-year Bsc DS&AI project, developed as part of [CoRoSect](https://corosect.eu/), a research collaboration between Maastricht University and [Field Lab Robotics](https://www.fieldlabrobotics.com/) aiming toward developing insect farms for sustainable food production. 

The goal of this project was to develop a programming interface which could be used by people without programming experience to control a model/demo insect farm, using [Googleâ€™s open-source Blockly project](https://developers.google.com/blockly) as a basis.
